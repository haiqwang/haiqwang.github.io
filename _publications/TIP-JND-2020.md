## Abstract
Abstractâ€”With explosive increase of internet video services, perceptual modeling for video quality has attracted more attentions to provide high quality-of-experience (QoE) for end-users subject to bandwidth constraints, especially for compressed video quality. In this paper, a novel perceptual model for satisfied-user- ratio (SUR) on compressed video quality is proposed by exploiting compressed video bitrate changes and spatial-temporal statistical characteristics extracted from both uncompressed original video and reference video. In the proposed method, an efficient video feature set is explored and established to model SUR curves against bitrate variations by leveraging the Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) framework. In particular, the proposed model is based on the recently released large-scale video quality dataset, VideoSet, and takes both spatial and temporal masking effects into consideration. To make it more practical, we further optimize the proposed method from three aspects including feature source simplification, computation complexity reduction and video codec adaption. Based on experimental results on VideoSet, the pro- posed method can accurately model SUR curves for various video contents and predict their required bitrates at given SUR values. Subjective experiments are conducted to further verify the generalization ability of the proposed SUR model.
